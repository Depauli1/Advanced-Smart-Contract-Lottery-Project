# Smart Contract Lottery

## Description
Introducing an innovative and advanced contract lottery project that revolutionizes the way individuals engage with lotteries. My project aims to create a transparent and secure ecosystem where users can participate by tickets for a chance win exciting rewards.

The foundation of the lottery system is built upon the principles of fairness and security. Leveraging the power of Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function), it ensures that the selection of winners is done in a fully decentralized and trustless manner. Chain VRF provides a cryptographically secure source of randomness, eliminating any potential for manipulation or bias.

To enhance the functionality of our lottery, we employ Chainlink Automation, a time-based trigger mechanism. This enables the automatic drawing of a after a specific period of time, removing any manual intervention and ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for all participants.

With our smart contract lottery, ticket fees go directly towards the eventual jackpot, maximizing the reward for the lucky winner. Through the utilization of the blockchain and smart contract technology, all transactions and operations are transparent and auditable, guaranteeing the integrity of the lottery process.

Join us as we redefine the lottery landscape, offering an advanced and transparent platform that brings excitement, fairness, and to users worldwide. Experience the thrill of our smart contract lottery and seize the opportunity to win big while ensuring a flawless and equitable gaming experience for all participants. 

# Getting Started

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
- [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
  - You'll know you did it right if you can run `forge --version` and you see a response like `forge 0.2.0 (816e00b 2023-03-16T00:05:26.396218Z)`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/Depauli1/Advanced-Smart-Contract-Lottery-Project
cd foundry-smart-contract-lottery-f23
forge build
```

# Usage

## Start a local node

```
make anvil
```

## Library

If you're having a hard time installing the chainlink library, you can optionally run this command. 

```
forge install smartcontractkit/chainlink-brownie-contracts@0.8.0 --no-commit
```

## Deploy

This will default to your local node. You need to have it running in another terminal in order for it to deploy.

```
make deploy
```

## Deploy - Other Network

[See below](#deployment-to-a-testnet-or-mainnet)

## Testing

I used the uint, integration and forked testing methods in my project.

```
forge test
```

or

```
forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

### Test Coverage

```
forge coverage
```

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variables

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

Optionally, add your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` if you want to verify your contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

1. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some testnet ETH. You should see the ETH show up in your metamask.

2. Deploy

```
make deploy ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

This will setup a ChainlinkVRF Subscription for you. If you already have one, update it in the `scripts/HelperConfig.s.sol` file. It will also automatically add your contract as a consumer.

3. Register a Chainlink Automation Upkeep

[You can follow the documentation if you get lost.](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-automation/compatible-contracts)

Go to [automation.chain.link](https://automation.chain.link/new) and register a new upkeep. Choose `Custom logic` as your trigger mechanism for automation. Your UI will look something like this once completed:

![Automation](./img/automation.png)

## Scripts

After deploying to a testnet or local net, you can run the scripts.

Using cast deployed locally example:

```
cast send <RAFFLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> "enterRaffle()" --value 0.1ether --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
```

or, to create a ChainlinkVRF Subscription:

```
make createSubscription ARGS="--network sepolia"
```

## Estimate gas

You can estimate how much gas things cost by running:
```
forge snapshot
```

And you'll see an output file called `.gas-snapshot`

# Formatting

To run code formatting:

```
forge fmt
```
